To the right, you can see statistical information about the dataset. You can either view it on a "State" or "Metro" level. The "State" level looks at each state as a whole, including both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. The "Metro" level looks at just the metropolitan areas. These two divisions were chosen because there is a proven statistical relationship between population and the types of crime reported in the FBI's UCR. The larger a jurisdiction's population the higher the property crime rate is likely to be [4]. Therefore, by studying the metropolitan areas in each state, we are examining the areas likely to be most impacted by legalization legislation.

You can also view the data for either Violent or Property crimes.

An observation we can make by looking at these statistics and graphs is that violent crime appears to be relatively normally distributed, with a long right tail. Property crime appears to be distributed more closely to a binomial distribution. Overall, the amount of property crime committed per year is much higher than the amount of violent crime, both on the state and metropolitan levels.
