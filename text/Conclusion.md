This application has analyzed the effect that the legalization of recreational cannabis has on both violent and property crime rates throughout the United States. Through testing, it was shown that there is a statistically significant relationship between recreational cannabis legalization and the rate of violent crime. Legalization leads to an increase in violent crime. No such relationship was able to be established between the legalization of recreational cannabis and the rate of property crime. More data is needed to determine if a relationship exists. 

My recommendation to state governments considering legalization is to hold off. Legalization could potentially lead to an increase in violent crime and more data is needed to determine the effects on property crime. If legalization legislation has already been passed, I would recommend allocating tax money that will be earned from the sale of cannabis to start programs that help to prevent future violent crime. A great example of such a program is the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Becoming a Man program. The program uses cognitive-behavioral principles to teach young men how to react to situations that may become violent. It has been shown to reduce the number of arrests by 30-50% during the time of participation in the program [6].
