This application has analyzed the effect that the legalization of recreational cannabis has on both violent and property crime rates throughout the United States. Through testing, it was shown that no statistically significant relationship could be found between rates of violent crime and the legalization of cannabis, nor between rates of property crime and the legalization of cannabis. This means that more data is needed to determine if a relationship indeed does exist.

My recommendation to state governments considering legalization is to look at all factors that may be impacted. Since the effects of legalization on crime rates are unclear, other factors such as the impacts to the economy and the health of citizens should be considered. I would tell a cautious governor to hold off on legalization until more data is available.
